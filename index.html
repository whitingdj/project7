        Now that we've looked at the architecture
        of the internet, let's see how you might


        connect your personal devices to
        the internet inside your house.


        Well there are many ways to
        connect to the internet, and

        most often people connect wirelessly.

        Let's look at an example of how
        you can connect to the internet.

        cable Internet, or a phone line if you

        your house, that connects you to
        the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.
        </p>

        you'll more likely have


        a dish outside your house, connecting
        you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or

        you might also use the telephone system.
        </p>

        <p>
        Whether a wire comes straight from
        the ISP hookup outside your house, or


        it travels over radio
        waves from your roof,


        the first stop a wire will make once
        inside your house, is at your modem.


        A modem is what connects the internet
        to your network at home.


        A few common residential modems are DSL or
